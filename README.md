### About Me:
Hi, I'm Aaron, a full-stack web development [bootcamp](https://www.epicodus.com/) graduate. Prior to retraining as a developer, my background was in medical logistics and education. I hold a Bachelors of Music in Composition and Music Technology from the University of Montana. My hobbies include making music, cooking, hiking, and video and tabletop games. I'm interested in web design, creative coding, digital audio, and game jams.
